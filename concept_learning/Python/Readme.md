## Python Notes

1. When a variable is float it can store upto 16 decimal point
2. Difference between '', "", ''' ''' -> Normally we use ''(single), but when we need to use ' in our string like, wasn't kind of words we can use "". But if our string contains both "" and ' then we use ''' to help python to know what is the actual start and end of string.
3. We can also have it in '' like 'I wasn\ 't planning to go out'
4. \n -> next line. \t is white space


5. Strings, List, Set, Dicstionaries, Tuples
6. Strings: Immutable
7. Slicing : substring of a string
8. List: Mutable
